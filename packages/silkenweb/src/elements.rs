//! Builders for HTML elements.
//!
//! Each HTML element has a function, a struct and a builder struct. The
//! function is a constructor for the builder. The builder has methods for each
//! attribute for that element, as well as methods for each event. For example:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use silkenweb::elements::{html::{a, A}, ElementEvents};
//! let link: A = a()
//!     .href("https://example.com/")
//!     .on_click(|event: web_sys::MouseEvent, link: web_sys::HtmlAnchorElement| {});
//! ```
//!
//! The builder type implements:
//!
//! - [`Element`]
//! - [`HtmlElement`]
//! - [`HtmlElementEvents`]
//! - [`ElementEvents`]
//! - [`ParentElement`] (if it is a parent element)
//! - [`ShadowRootParent`] (if it's allowed to have a shadow root attached)
//!
//! [`ParentElement`]: crate::node::element::ParentElement
//! [`ShadowRootParent`]: crate::node::element::ShadowRootParent
